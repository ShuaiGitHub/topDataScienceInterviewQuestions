####Singular Value Decomposition

from wikipedia
In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. It is the generalization of the eigendecomposition of a positive semidefinite normal matrix (for example, a symmetric matrix with positive eigenvalues) to any m \times n matrix via an extension of polar decomposition. It has many useful applications in signal processing and statistics.
